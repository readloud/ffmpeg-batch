To change the Text-to-Speech (TTS) content for a new tutorial, you simply need to modify the **"Define your scenes"** section within your `Tutorial_Maker.bat` file.

Since the script uses a specific pattern to read your input, you can add, remove, or edit the text variables to create entirely different voiceovers and on-screen text.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Modification

**1. Locate the Scene Definitions**
Look for the lines starting with `set "s1=...` and `set "s2=...` in your batch file. The format is strictly:
`"FileName | Voice Audio Text | On-Screen Display Text"`.

**2. Update the Text**

* 
**FileName:** Change `scene_1` to `new_tutorial_1` if you want to keep files separate.


* 
**Voice Text:** This is what the PowerShell AI will speak.


* 
**Display Text:** This is what appears as "typing" on the video. **Reminder:** Always use `\:` to escape colons in the display text to avoid FFmpeg errors.



**3. Adjust the Loop Range**
If you add more scenes (e.g., `s3`, `s4`), you must update the `for` loop to include them.

### Example: Creating a "Coding" Tutorial

Change your existing code  to this:

```batch
:: Define your new scenes 
set "s1=code_1|Today we will learn how to print Hello World in Python.|Python Tutorial: Hello World"
set "s2=code_2|Type print followed by parentheses and quotes.|Step 1\: print('Hello World')"

:: Update this line to include your new scene variables
for %%S in ("%s1%" "%s2%") do ( 

```

### 🔊 How to Change the Voice (Gender/Accent)

The PowerShell command in your script uses the default Windows System Voice. To change who is speaking, you can modify the PowerShell line to select a different voice by index or name:

**To list available voices on your computer, run this in CMD:**
`powershell -Command "Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; $speak = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; $speak.GetInstalledVoices().VoiceInfo"`

**To force a specific voice (e.g., Microsoft Zira) in your script:**
Change the PowerShell command  to:
`powershell -Command "Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; $speak = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; $speak.SelectVoice('Microsoft Zira'); $speak.SetOutputToWaveFile('%OUT%\temp.wav'); $speak.Speak('!voice!'); $speak.Dispose()"`

### 📂 Pro-Tip for Folders

If you are starting a completely new tutorial, change the `set "OUT=final_tutorial"` line to a new folder name (like `set "OUT=python_tutorial"`) so you don't overwrite your previous work.

**Would you like me to show you how to add a "Transition" effect (like a fade-to-black) between these new scenes in the Merge script?**

Adding transitions like a **fade-to-black** makes your tutorial look like a finished product rather than just a series of clips glued together.

### 🎬 How to Add Transitions

Because "fades" require re-encoding (you can't just "copy" the video data as we did before), the `Merge.bat` script needs to be more powerful. We will use an FFmpeg filter called `xfade`.

#### Updated: Merge_with_Transitions.bat

Replace your current `Merge.bat` content with this. It includes a **1-second black fade** between clips:

```batch
@echo off
set "FOLDER=final_tutorial"
set "OUT_FILE=master_tutorial_with_fades.mp4"

echo 🎬 Merging scenes with smooth transitions...

:: 1. Identify your scenes
set "S1=%FOLDER%\scene_1.mp4"
set "S2=%FOLDER%\scene_2.mp4"

[cite_start]:: 2. Check if files exist [cite: 7]
if not exist "%S1%" (
    echo ❌ Missing %S1%. Run Tutorial_Maker.bat first.
    pause & exit /b
)

:: 3. Run the XFADE command
:: offset is the time (in seconds) when the transition starts. 
:: If Scene 1 is 4 seconds, offset=3 starts the fade 1 second before it ends.
ffmpeg -y -i "%S1%" -i "%S2%" -filter_complex ^
"[0:v][1:v]xfade=transition=fade:duration=1:offset=3[v]; ^
 [0:a][1:a]acrossfade=d=1[a]" ^
-map "[v]" -map "[a]" -pix_fmt yuv420p "%OUT_FILE%"

echo ✨ Master Tutorial with Fades Finished!
pause

```

### 📘 How to Manage Multiple Tutorials

Since you asked how to change the TTS for another tutorial, here is the best way to keep your files organized:

1. **Duplicate the Maker:** Copy `Tutorial_Maker.bat` and rename it to `Tutorial_Python.bat` or `Tutorial_Music.bat`.
2. 
**Change the Folder:** Inside the new script, change `set "OUT=final_tutorial"` to `set "OUT=python_tutorial"`.


3. 
**Edit the Scenes:** Update the `set "s1=..."` lines with your new script and voiceover text.


4. 
**Update the Loop:** Ensure the `for %%S in ("%s1%" "%s2%" ...)` line includes every scene variable you created.



### 💡 Pro-Tip for Transitions

The `offset` value in the `xfade` command must be calculated based on the length of your first clip. If your voiceover is 5 seconds long, set `offset=4`. If you have many clips, it is often easier to use the standard `Merge.bat`  and add a "Fade In/Out" directly inside the `Tutorial_Maker.bat` for every individual scene.

**Would you like me to add a simple "Fade In" and "Fade Out" effect to the `Tutorial_Maker.bat` so every scene automatically blends when you merge them?**

ffmpeg -y -f lavfi -i color=c=0x1e1e1e:s=1920x1080:d=!dur! -i "%OUT%\temp.wav" ^
-vf "drawtext=fontfile='C\:/Windows/Fonts/arial.ttf':text='!display!':fontcolor=white:fontsize=60:x=(W-tw)/2:y=(H-th)/2" ^
-c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p "%OUT%\!fname!.mp4"

Create a text file in the same folder as your script. Use a pipe symbol (|) to separate the filename, the voice text, and the on-screen text.

Format: FileName|VoiceText|OnScreenText

2. Updated Tutorial_Maker.bat
This version uses a FOR /F loop to read each line of your text file.
